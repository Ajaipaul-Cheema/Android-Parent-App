<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
* This app allows for making fair decisions for your children and handling any disputes between them. Children's names can be saved and be assigned to tasks. After 
  finishing a task, it will be the next child's turn to do that specific task. This app tracks this list of children's tasks and who just finished a task and who's
  turn it is to do it next in order to maintain fairness for these children. 
* Also, when the parents need to ensure their children calm down, this app has breathing
  animations coupled with calming sounds and it also has a timer for children's timeouts. Additionally, this app also features flipping a coin so that a child could 
  decide upon something based on a flip of a coin.
